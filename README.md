The AI system can make more accurate short-term predictions, including for critical storms and floods.

So in our project we are calculating weather predictions for race engineers relay precise information to drivers, including:
- How many minutes until it starts raining
- Intensity of the rain
- Which corner will be hit first by the rain
- Duration of the rain
 
Climate change is making it harder to anticipate adverse weather conditions, as the frequency and severity of heavy rain increases, which researchers believe will lead to both significant material damage and death.
